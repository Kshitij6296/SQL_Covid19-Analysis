# SQL_Covid19-Analysis


For this SQL project analyzing Covid-19 data from March 2020 to June 2021, I utilized the deaths and vaccination tables obtained 
from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. 
The dataset was imported into a SQL Database on my local machine using MS-SQL Server, and I conducted an exploratory analysis using both basic and advanced 
SQL queries.
